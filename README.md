# SMS-Spam-detection-Proj

📌 Project Overview

SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project designed to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). This end-to-end solution includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training of various supervised machine learning models to identify spam messages effectively.

📊 Key Features

📂 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Removed noise, stopwords, special characters; applied text normalization techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized message distribution, word frequency, message length distribution, and more to understand data patterns.

🧠 Model Training & Comparison:
Trained and tested multiple supervised ML models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🏆 Best Performing Model:
Among all models, Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score, making it the best choice for this classification task.

✅ Model Evaluation:
Used confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curves to evaluate model performance.
